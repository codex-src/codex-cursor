# Hey there! 👋

**Thank you for checking this out!** This is a WYSIWYG (_what-you-see-is-what-you-get_) markdown editor. You can format text using syntax characters, like underscores `_` _for italics_ and asterisks `**` **for bold**. This makes it easy for you to copy documents in-and-out of the Codex editor without losing formatting. 👌

This guide will make you comfortable using GitHub Flavored Markdown, also known as _GFM_. **Feedback is greatly appreciated.** If you have an idea or feedback, simply DM me at [@username_ZAYDEK](https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK) on Twitter to get in touch! This editor is very much a labor of love. ❤️

Final tips:
- **This document is saved to localStorage** — refresh whenever
- **You can toggle Preview mode** to preview your document _without_ markdown syntax
- **You can toggle HTML** to export your document _as_ HTML

## Headers

You can format:
- [ ] `# ` for headers
- [ ] `## ` for subheaders

**Try creating some headers** and toggle the checkboxes when you’re done.

## Blockquotes and lists

You can format:
- [ ] `> ` for blockquotes (use `>` (without a space) for empty blockquotes)
- [ ] `- ` or `* ` for lists
- [ ] `- [ ] ` or `- [x] ` for checklists (you can use `tab` and `shift-tab` to indent lists)

**Try creating some blockquotes and lists** and toggle the checkboxes when you’re done.

## Code blocks

You can format:
- [ ] ~```~ or `~~~` for code blocks
- [ ] ~```lang~ or `~~~lang` for syntax-highlighted code blocks

All of the following language extensions are supported for syntax highlighting:

```
bash c cpp css d diff docker dockerfile git go graphql htm html http js json jsx kotlin php py rb ruby rust sass sh sql svg swift ts tsx wasm xml yaml yml
```

**Try creating some code blocks or edit the following code blocks** and toggle the checkboxes when you’re done.

```main.go
package main

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

```App.js
const App = () => (
	<div className="flex flex-row justify-center items-center">
		<h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl leading-tight">
			Hello, world!
		</h1>
	</div>
)

export default App
```

- [ ] `[Link](href)` for [links](https://google.com)
