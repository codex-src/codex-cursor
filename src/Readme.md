## Readme

**You can edit this readme at anytime**, but only your note will persist changes.

**Codex is a new WYSIWYG markdown editor for devs. 👩🏾‍💻👨🏼‍💻** As you type in the editor, your notes are synced to localStorage. You can always copy and paste your notes in and out of Codex and you’ll never loose formatting. ✨

Codex is based on GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). That means you can use syntax characters like underscores `_` for _italics_ and asterisks `*` for **bold** to format text, right from your browser!

Here’s a primer:

You can use _italics_, **bold**, `code`, and ~strikethrough~. Alternate syntax is also supported: *italics*, __bold__, and ~~strikethrough~~ also work. Finally, you can use ***bold and italics*** or ___bold and italics___.

> This is a blockquote
>
> Blockquotes can be multiline -- use > without a space for empty lines

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

**Syntax highlighting is supported based on the language extension or filename you provide.** For example, you can use `.go` or `main.go` for Go, and `jsx` or `App.jsx` for JavaScript with React syntax. Most languages are supported.

Finally, you can add section breaks using either syntax:
