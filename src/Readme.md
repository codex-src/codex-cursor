## Readme

> 👋 This is an _interactive_ readme; type to make changes!

**Codex is a markdown editor for devs.** Codex is based on GitHub Flavored Markdown, meaning you can format notes using special _syntax_ characters. This also means when you copy text, you _never_ loose formatting. ✨

**Your note is saved to localStorage.** This means when you refresh the page, your changes persist. Soon, Codex will be developed into web app that syncs to the cloud. ☁️

### Code blocks

```main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Syntax highlighting is supported for all of the following languages (you can use a filename, like `main.go`, or just the extension, like `go`):

```
bash c cpp css d diff docker dockerfile git go graphql htm html http js json jsx kotlin php py rb ruby rust sass sh sql svg swift ts tsx wasm xml yaml yml
```

### Lists

Use `- ` or `* ` for unordered lists:

- Yo, I heard you like unordered lists
	- So I put an unordered list inside of an unordered list 😎

You can also use `1. ` (or any number) for ordered lists:

1. This is a numbered list
1. Numbered lists are auto-incremented for you
1. Internally, ordered list items are as `1. `

You can also use `- ` for unchecked checkboxes and `- [x]` for checked checkboxes.

- [x] ?!?!!?!?
	- [x] ?!?!!!?!?
		- [x] ???!?!?!!
	- [x] !?!?!?!!
- [ ] **PROFIT!!**

You can use `tab` and `shift-tab` to tab and detab lists.

### Section breaks

Use `---` or `***` to create section breaks:
